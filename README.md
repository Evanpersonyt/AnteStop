# AnteStop

Plugin under development but everything works well! 
----
the plugin is used to
- reload the server after 3 seconds (/tempreload) (customizable in config.yml)
- restart the server after 3 seconds (/temprestart) (also customizable in config.yml) 
- and the best 'maintenance' this is used to automatically kick non-op players with a personalized message (to config in config.yml) also puts a message before maintenance (3sec by default, also customizable in config.yml)
